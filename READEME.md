# Introduction
This python script is realized by utilizing win32 API python tools. 
Essentially, it's achieved by simulation of keyboard and mouse operation
along with appropriate color recognition and image retrival methods, that is,
it's not a 100% reliable tool. Because usually it depends on how good quality
of your network environment, how fast your computer responds to mouse or keyboard
events.

# Notice
Any user should be aware that this works only after you correctly modified the 
coordinates according to your own screen resolution and UI scaling settings. 
> I finished this script on a 4K screen with 150% scaling.
